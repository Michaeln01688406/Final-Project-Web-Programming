            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
               My name is Michael Bui, and I'm an
               international student from Vietnam currently 
               studying Computer Programming and Analysis at Humber College.
               I moved to Canada during middle school, an
               experience that shaped me and taught me adaptability at a young age.
            </p>
            <p>
                My journey into programming began in grade 11 when I was
                introduced to Java. That first exposure sparked my curiosity
                and solidified my passion for coding, leading me to pursue a future in technology.
                Since then, I've been dedicated to developing my skills and exploring the endless 
                possibilities of programming.
            </p>

                Gaming has been a significant part of my life,
                both as a hobby and a source of inspiration. I hope to combine my love for gaming
                with my programming expertise and contribute to the world of game development in
                the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                The experience of moving to a new country and adapting to a different culture has given 
                me resilience and a unique perspective that I bring to everything I do.
                I'm excited to continue learning, growing, and contributing to the tech industry.
            </p>
            <p>Thank you for taking the time to learn about me!</p>
